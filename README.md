### Goal

This is MVC CRUD application. I coded this project to practice on my knowledge HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, PHP (OOP),
MySQL in a real project.

### Benefits

Here are some ideas to benefit from this project:

- Take this project as a task and try to make it, and if you could not do a specific section, see how I make it in the
  source code (use comments to reach this section).
- Extract a code of a specific section and use it in your project.
- Review source code to see how other people code their projects.
- Edit on this project after studying its code well, to know how to work in pair-programming with other people
- Upgrade this project, and add your own sections or pages

### Installation

Here are the guidelines to run this project on your localhost:

1. Download, then install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) web server
2. Download this project, then rename its directory to `mvc-crud`
3. Copy the `mvc-crud` directory to the `htdocs` directory which exists in XAMPP installation path
4. Start XAMPP control panel from your Desktop, then start `Apache` web server, and `MySQL` server
5. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`, to open PHPMyAdmin home page
6. Create a new database with the name `s_mvc_crud`
7. Import the `s_mvc_crud.sql` file to this database (This file located in `sql` directory)
8. Open your browser, and type `http://localhost/mvc-crud`, to open the home page of the website

> You must make a virtual host like `mvc-crud.local` for this project, otherwise you will encounter non-accurate routes. If you don't know how to make virtual hosts in XAMPP, then it is the time to search ^_^

> Don't forget to edit the `/app/config.php` file with your Database credentials
